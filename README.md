AhuKhan, Prophecy of The Fallen Gods

![QpzF9m](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/989e28dd-f8e9-47ba-a20e-a5f1c87870ef)

>> Play as Ahau Kâ€™an, the chosen Guardian tasked with restoring balance after the gods unleash chaos upon the world. Face divine trials, master powerful combat abilities, and confront ancient deities in a fight for survival.
About the Project :
Developed in Unreal Engine 5 by a team of 12 students â€” 7 artists and 5 programmers â€” over the course of 3 months.

My Contributions :
- Built the full player combat system: melee combos, dodge, block, and ranged attacks (CPP and Blueprints)
- Set up animation logic: montages, transitions, and weapon-based hitboxes (Animation Blueprints)
- Integrated most VFX and SFX: trails, impacts, adaptive music cues
- Ensured tight gameplay feel and responsive feedback throughout the experience
