Welcome to Thomas' GitHub! ðŸ‘‹
Hey! I'm Thomas, a student developer at Creajeux NÃ®mes. I'm heading into my final year of studies. Here are some projects I've worked on, feel free to give them a try!

>> Motion Recognition VR <<
This is my final year study project. The goal is to develop a motion recognition system that translates gestures into 3D shapes in virtual reality, using a Quest 3 headset. The system recognizes user-defined gestures and launches "spells" based on the gesture drawn within the VR environment.

Project Progress:
What is already done:
Gesture Recognition System: Developed a system that recognizes and compares gestures made by the player, matching them with pre-stored binary gesture files.

Spell Generation: Implemented a mechanic where specific shapes trigger the casting of different spells based on the gesture performed.

VR Interaction: Integrated the system within a VR environment, allowing users to physically draw shapes and cast spells.

AI Integration: Adding an AI system that will eventually interpret movements and predict spell outcomes based on prior training.



>> VR Climbing Simulation <<
This project focuses on creating a VR climbing experience with procedurally generated cliffs. Players will need to manage their endurance as they climb, with different holds draining stamina at varying rates, similar to mechanics in Zelda: Breath of the Wild.

>> Unity Procedural Generation <<
This project is focused on learning procedural generation techniques. Iâ€™m working on creating random terrain that adapts to the playerâ€™s climbing path, using noise functions to generate realistic cliffs and environments.
