Welcome to Thomas' GitHub! ðŸ‘‹
Hey! I'm Thomas, a student developer at Creajeux in NÃ®mes, currently in my final year of studies. Here are some of the projects Iâ€™ve worked onâ€”feel free to explore them!

>> The Rite <<
This game takes you on a journey as a young Skrokac, preparing for their coming-of-age ritual. Things quickly go awry, and itâ€™s up to you to navigate the challenges.
In this project, I worked on the player character and developed the Hypervision power that allows players to see hidden elements and solve puzzles through walls.

Engine used: Unity
Team size: 11
Project duration: 5 months

>> Minion Invasion <<
In a medieval fantasy world, a magic portal opens, bringing hordes of monsters. As part of the kingdom's army, you must repel the invaders.
I worked on creating player spells, including one that spawns meteors and another that empowers turrets.
